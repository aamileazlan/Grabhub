# GrabHub - Campus Food Rescue Platform

*2nd Place, De Anza College Hackathon 4.0 | Fall 2025*

## The Problem

During my first weeks at De Anza, I noticed two disconnected problems:
- Student clubs regularly had trays of untouched food after events
- Students around me were skipping meals because groceries were too expensive

Two needs, one campus, no bridge. That connection became GrabHub.

## The Solution

A real-time mobile app where student organizations can instantly post surplus food for students to claim before it goes to waste.

### Core Features
- **Real-time notifications:** Students get alerts when food is posted nearby
- **Location-based matching:** Find available food sorted by proximity
- **Campus email verification:** Ensures only De Anza students can access
- **Photo uploads & expiry timers:** Organizations post what's available with pickup deadlines
- **Quick claiming interface:** Students reserve meals with one tap

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend:** React Native (cross-platform mobile app)
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express (API server)
- **Database:** Supabase (real-time data sync)
- **Features:** Geolocation services, push notifications, image upload/storage

## The 48-Hour Build

As team leader at DAHacks 4.0, I guided our team through:
1. **Ideation:** Pitched the food waste problem when brainstorming stalled
2. **Architecture design:** Split tasks based on team strengths
3. **Development:** Built and tested features under time pressure
4. **Crisis management:** 10 minutes before deadline, a code update froze the entire app. Instead of panicking, I guided the team to methodically debug line-by-line until we isolated the issue and recovered with seconds to spare

## Impact & Recognition

- **2nd Place** at De Anza College Hackathon 4.0
- Demonstrated how technical solutions can address interconnected social problems (food waste + food insecurity)
- Proved concept for scalable campus-wide implementation

## What I Learned

Building GrabHub taught me that creativity isn't just having ideas—it's seeing what others overlook (the food waste/hunger connection) and executing under pressure. The real test wasn't writing the code; it was staying calm when everything broke minutes before presentation and trusting the team to solve it together.
